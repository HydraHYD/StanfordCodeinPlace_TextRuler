# StanfordCodeinPlace_TextRuler
Code for a measuring script to check the width and height of text objects to make them easier to work with in the graphics library.

To run this program you MUST HAVE the Stanford python graphics library imported. 
The purpose of this tool is to measure texts objects for the Stanford Code in Place graphics portion since there currently seems to be no easy way to do so outside of trial and error.
